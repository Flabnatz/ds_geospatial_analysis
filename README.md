## Useful Notes
The Earth's radius is (on average) 3,959 miles or 6,371 km

Latitude is the azimuthal angle (typically phi).
Longitude is the radial angle (typically theta)

The shortest distance between two points in spherical geometry is along a Great Circle.
The Haversine Formula is used to calculate the distance between two lat, lon points on a sphere.
All latitudes are Great Circles.
